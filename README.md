# DOS  Script

The Load Test Script is a powerful tool that allows you to perform load testing on web servers using Python and Node.js. Load testing is essential for determining the performance and stability of a web application under various levels of user traffic. By simulating multiple requests per second (RPS) to a given URL, you can assess how well your server handles the load and identify potential bottlenecks or performance issues.
